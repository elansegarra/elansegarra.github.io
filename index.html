    I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and I am on the job market during 2020-2021. As an applied econometrician I am bent on developing, improving, and applying the empirical tools used by researchers across a range of disciplines.

    As a methodologist I study the implications (and solutions) of record linkage errors on empirical analysis.
    I also study how graphical causal models (i.e. directed acyclic graphs) can be leveraged for identification in both structural and reduced form frameworks.
    As an applied economist I am interested in public policy evaluation (e.g. the effects of sanctuary policies on crime and crime reporting) as well as the science of science.

    My career path has roamed from working at a plant nursery in San Francisco, to working as a data analyst at CREDO, to developing a structural model of the criminal justice system at RAND. Feel free to browse the rest of the site to find out more information about my research, teaching experience, and background.
