    I am a Research Economist at the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> in the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/crp/">Compensation Research and Program Development Group</a>. 
    As an applied econometrician I am bent on developing, improving, and applying the empirical tools used by researchers across a range of disciplines.

  <p>
    As a methodologist I study the implications of (and solutions to) record linkage error on downstream empirical analysis.
    My work at BLS involves the application of frontier statistical disclosure control methods as well as the development new procerdures and techniques.
    I also study how graphical causal models (i.e. directed acyclic graphs) can be leveraged for identification in both structural and reduced form frameworks.
    As an applied economist I am interested in public policy evaluation (e.g. the effects of sanctuary policies on crime and crime reporting) as well as the science of science.

    My career path has roamed from working at a plant nursery in San Francisco, to working as a data analyst at CREDO, to developing a structural model of the criminal justice system at RAND, to working on record linkage issues and disclosure at the BLS. Feel free to browse the rest of the site to find out more about my research, teaching experience, and background.
