This is where I will talk about the python packages that I have developed.

## BDRL (Birth Death Record Linkage)
Provides estimators for recovering unobserved duration distributions using data
that is subject to record linkage error.

## Monte Carlo Simulations
Provides generic methods to implement Monte Carlo simulations in python.
Simply provide a function that generates a data set and a function that computes statistic(s) or interest and the methods will perform the simulations.
Auxiliary methods, such as for stability analysis or computing multiple MC simulations across a range of parameter values, are also provided.

## ArDa (Article Database)
This python application organizes research articles and the meta data associated with them.
It allows the user to download meta data, group articles into projects (or reading lists), produce bib files, and create notes that are article/project specific.
