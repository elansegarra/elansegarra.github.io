**Course Description**: The purpose of this class is to give you the tools and language to start thinking like an economist. Additionally, this course serves as the gateway to an entire field that is both broad and incredibly influential in our modern world. We will be looking at the branch called Microeconomics which focuses on individual consumers and firms as opposed to the economy as a whole (Macroeconomics). Our discussions will range from the foundations of supply and demand, to the effects of government policies like minimum wage laws. By the end you will have a firm grasp of the fundamentals of Microeconomics as well as an analytic tool set that can be applied both to claims made by politicians and also to everyday decisions in your own life.
