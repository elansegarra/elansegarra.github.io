## Tutoring

Rate: $30/hr (group rates available upon request)

I have been tutoring continuously for the last 15 years with a focus on mathematics and statistics courses at nearly all educational levels (from middle school through undergraduate). Since I received my bachelor's degree in mathematics and master's in economics I mostly tutor for Econ 310 (Statistics: Measurement in Economics) and Econ 410 (Introductory Econometrics). That being said I am open to tutoring for other economics or mathematics courses as well. If you have questions or are interested in setting up an appointment please contact me at segarra@wisc.edu.
